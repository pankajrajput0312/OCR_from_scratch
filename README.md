# OCR_from_scratch
Currently in progress.
I'm planning to build OCR from scratch. 
Main task is to extract text from Online Exams Questions paper pdf itself.
Main Features I'm planning to include:
- Able to detect Questions and Answers properly
- Detect Diagrams, Table 
- Extract text 
- Extract Mathematical equations and convert directly into Latex format.
